Description: QuTiP: Quantum toolbox in Python (Python 2)
 Python framework for solving the dynamics of quantum systems.
 QuTiP is an open-source framework for solving the dynamics of open and closed
 quantum systems written in Python. The focus of QuTiP is on systems with
 Hamiltonians that are composed of harmonic oscillator modes and multi-level
 (typically two-levels) atoms, where the Hilbert space may be constructed using
 the Fock basis. This large class of Hamiltonians appears in a wide variety of
 physical problems, including those in quantum optics, trapped ions,
 superconducting circuit devices, and mechanical systems in the quantum regime.
