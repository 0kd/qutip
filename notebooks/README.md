QuTiP development test notebooks
================================

These files are [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) for
testing different parts of QuTiP. These tests serves a somewhat different
purpose than the unit test suite that is installed as a part of QuTiP. Instead
of being small isolated (unit) tests, these notebooks are often more like
integration tests, which exercise a larger part of the QuTiP codebase to make
sure that different parts work together as expected, or tests that exercise
various related parts in a module in a single location.

To open these files, start an IPython notebook server by running the following
command in the directory that contains the files:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your web browser, showing the IPython notebook
dashboard page with an index of all the notebooks.

Online read-only versions
=========================

You can also view the notebooks online, as read-only HTML pages rendered by
