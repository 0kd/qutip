def n_thermal(w, w_th):
    """
    Return the number of photons in thermal equilibrium for an harmonic
    oscillator mode with frequency 'w', at the temperature described by
    'w_th' where :math:`\\omega_{\\rm th} = k_BT/\\hbar`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    w : *float* or *array*
        Frequency of the oscillator.

    w_th : *float*
        The temperature in units of frequency (or the same units as `w`).


    Returns
    -------

    n_avg : *float* or *array*

        Return the number of average photons in thermal equilibrium for a
        an oscillator with the given frequency and temperature.
