QuTiP Development Test notebooks
================================

These files are IPython notebooks for testing different parts of QuTiP. These
tests serves a somewhat different purpose than the qutip unit test suite, which
is installed together with QuTiP. Instead of being small isolated (unit) tests,
these notebooks are often more like integration tests, which exercise a larger
part of the QuTiP codebase to make sure that different parts work together as
expected, or tests that exercise various related parts in a module in a single
location.

To open these files, start an IPython notebook server by running the following
command in the directory that contains the files:

    $ ipython notebook

This will open a new page in your web browser, showing the IPython notebook
dashboard page with an index of all the notebooks.

Online read-only versions
